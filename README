Prolog for JCU


Installation instructions:
==========================

This software has been tested with Haskell Platform 2011.2.0.1, 32-bit on Mac
OS X 10.6.7, using MongoDB 1.8.1. MongoDB was installed using Homebrew.

* Install MongoDB *
To install MongoDB using Homebrew, issue the following command:

brew install mongodb

When the installation is finished, follow the instructions on the screen.
The application assumes that MongoDB listens on localhost:27017.

* Install dependencies *
The JCU packages relies on the snap-auth and snap-extension-mongodb packages,
both of which are not yet available on hackage. If you have not installed them
yet, issue a 'make deps' command. The latest version of these packages will be
fetched from git and be installed. A git client must be installed for this to
work.

* Install the JCU package *
To install the JCU package in development mode, issue a 'make' command in the
project root. To install it in production mode, just issue cabal install in the
project root.
