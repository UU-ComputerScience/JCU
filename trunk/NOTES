PUT: Store the list of stored rules as is currently available on the client-side.


/rules/hint
POST: Submits all current rules used in a derivation to the server, which will calculate a set of next possible rules that can be applied.

/rules/check
POST: Submits all current rules used and checks if the derivation sequence is valid.
